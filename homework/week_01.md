# Week 01 Question Set
### What is your prior experience in this discipline?
None. I haven't had much -omics experience at all. I have looked at a set of genes of interest and looked at differences in expression in a defined gene list but haven't looked at whole transcript output.

### What do you hope to get out of this class?
I hope to develop a workflow for processing RNAseq data that will be transferable across data sets since I currently don't have the RNAseq data I will be using for the second chapter of my thesis.

### This class is strongly rooted in an independent project related to genomic analyses. What specific project do you have in mind? If you do not have any data or preference, data can be provided / aquired. If you do not have a specfic project, what approach would you like to master as part of this class?
I currently have access to an old *Daphnia magna* RNAseq data set but will be looking online for past work done on *Botryllus schlosseri* transcriptome work to see what is available for me to work on.

### What are two things you found most useful from the reading?
- Thinking about the ability to create reproducible analyses with the ever changing nature of software, reference genomes and annotations, and online data management.

- Producing metadata as you go to avoid confusion as to why later on your workflow isn't reproducible.
