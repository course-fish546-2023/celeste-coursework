1. **What is your goal with respect to your research project to get accomplished this week?**
This week I would like to finish cleaning up my explanatory figures. I also want to attempt completing a functional enrichment analysis since I now have GO terms annotated for my differentially expressed gene list.

2. **What is the overall status of your research repo? Is it will organized with a clear Readme file? Are file names and directory clear? Would your classmates be able to understand what the code in your files is designed to do?**
I feel like it could be better organized but the current organization schema is OK. Other students are definitely able to go through my workflow and utilize it so it must be clear enough, but I would like to update the ReadMe file.

3. **Go to one of your classmates rpubs link (see issues). What are three things you think are neat? What are two things that are really not that clear to you?**
I like that the workflow of there whole bioinformatics project is represented in a figure. I think that helps for people not familiar with bioinformatics digest the page, I also like how the workflow is broken down with headers that are underlined on the page, additionally, I like the code highlight option they selected, it contrasts well against the white page and makes it easier to read. I think that their code can be better commented out however, more detail into why they did what they did would be nice.
