1.  **Looking back on the quarter what are two things you were not expecting to learn but did, glad you did, and how would you implement this knowledge beyond this class?**
I wasn't expecting to use as many tools involved in visualizing the genome and or transcriptome. That will be a useful tool to carry on using beyond this class and into my research work.

2.  **Rank the following from 1-5, with 1 being your best friend and 5 being your enemy (raven, rstudio, knitr, bash, github)**
github, rstudio, bash, knitr, ***raven*** (emphasis on raven being my enemy)

3.  **As part of your research project you must of learned something beyond methods. What is the most important biological finding from your work to to date? Assuming you follow this line of research what is your long term goal of what you expect to learn about biology, ecology, or the environment? ** 
It was interesting to visualize the distinct differences in gene expression of two different blastogenic stages of *Botryllus schlosseri*. Specifically, the take over stage of the blastogenic cycle of *Botryllus* is an extremely interesting period biologically as stem-like cells are transferring into the next generation of zooids. Furthermore, this stage in *Botryllus* is uniquely the best for initiating primary cell cultures, likely due to the aforementioned regenerative properties and the TO stage marking the start of the blastogenic cycle thus cells that grow from tissue at that stage last longer in culture. What I think would be cool to investigate outside of identifying change in the transcriptome from the *in vivo* to *in vitro* states would be to evaluate what transcriptomic factors may influence the suitability for the TO stage to be cultured.
