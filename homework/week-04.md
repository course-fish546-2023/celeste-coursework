a)  **What is `tmux` and how does this relate to our current way of working on raven?**
Tmux (terminal multiplexer) allows you to utilize multiple terminal sessions simultaneously as well as is persistent in the sense that the remote session can remain active even if your network drops or you close your terminal. This latter aspect has been a key component int the work have done using raven thus far.

b)  **What is `ssh` and what would the code be you would type if you were going to `ssh` into raven?**
SSH refers to secure shell which is a method of connecting to a remote machine through the terminal. The code I have used in a terminal to ssh into raven has been: 
ssh cvaldi@raven.fish.washington.edu

c)  **What has been the most challenging part of your research project? Are you happy with your organization skills? If not what could be improved?**
The most challenging part so far regarding my project has been understanding the unique workflow I have to build for the data I have based off of tangential examples. This has involved learning to access data for my source, creating an ideal organization scheme for the workflow and where I store code and data, and I project it may be difficult to get started learning to use HiSat2. 

My organization skills are okay and I am happy enough with them thus far.

d)  **For last weeks assignment what did you appreciate the most about knitting documents?**

I liked going back and captioning out the code I wrote so that it may be understandable to someone else or future me.
